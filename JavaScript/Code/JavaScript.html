  <div>
    <h2 class="pfade" id="day36">Day 36 — Basic JavaScript Part 1</h2>
  </div>
  <br/>
<div>
<p class="pfade">
Evening everyone.
I took a couple days from blogging to work on understanding WordPress and to some new aspects of computing, as I am trying to build a little ground in this area, I’m always keen to learn something new and a day without learning feels like a day wasted.
As the title shows, we are heading into completey new territory. I have never laid a finger of thought on JavaScript so I’m going into this totally blind. Let’s see what FreeCodeCamp has in store for us tonight.
<br/><br/>

According to FreeCodeCamp’s introduction on JavaScript:
<p class="pfade box">JavaScript is a high-level programming language that all modern web browsers support. It is also one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS that you may have learned previously. This section will cover basic JavaScript programming concepts, which range from variables and arithmetic to objects and loops.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Commenting on JavaScript</h4>
<p class="pfade">When we write in this language, we aren’t using the same commenting techniques as HTML, JS uses two ways to comment:
The asterisk and forward slash for multi line coding:</p>

<p class="pfade box">/* hello here is a comment </p>

<p class="pfade"> Using two forward slashes before text for in-line comments, which means to ignore the rest of the text on that line after the two forward slashes.</p>
<p class="pfade box"> // Here is another comment </p>

<p class="pfade"> This is useful for other devs reading your code to understand what each chunk of your code is doing, and also useful for you in future referring back on something with a bit of context. I personally refer back alot so this will be helpful for that. Your welcome, future me. </p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade"> Declaring Variables </h4>
<p class="pfade"> This harks me back to Python, or what little I learnt of it on a phone app. Data is anything of value to the computer, and in JS, there are 8 total data types, which we’ll learn about as we go along:
<br/>
<b>underfined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number and object.</b>
<br/><br/>
Computers can do mathematical equations with numbers, but not with strings, as strings are typed characters such as “Hello 123”.
A variable can be used to store and minipulate a data type, by stating it without directly using it. It is not a mathematical variable as it merely creates a value for a set of data at different times, and can be written with letters, numbers, an underscore (“_”) or a $ sign. But it cannot begin with a number or include spaces.
We can declare a variable in JS with the shorthand “var” preceding it and then state it’s custom label. For example:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var aName;</p>

<p class="pfade"><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note:</span> The semi-colon ends the variable label.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Storing Variables with Assignment Operators</h4>
<p class="pfade">What is an assignment operator? Easy. It’s the equals sign (=).
If we want to assign a variable to a data type such as a number, we declare the variable as learnt above, and then define the variable on the left side of the assignment operator, and it’s corresponding number value on the right of the assignment operator. From then on, the code will represent that variable with that specific number value:</p>
<p class="pfade box"> var number5;<br>
number5 = 5;</p>

<p class="pfade">Sounds about right doesn’t it?
</div>
<br/><br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Assigning the Value of One Variable to Another Variable</h4>

<p class="pfade">If we want to create a variable with the same value of another variable, we simply use the assignment operator to say this variable is equal to that variable, and the value of the two is then the same. We define one (line 1), give it a value (line 2), then define the other (line 3) and give it the value of the first one (line 4):</p>
<p class="pfade box">
 var var1;<br>
 var1 = 1;<br>
 var var2;<br>
 var2 = var1;</p>
<p class="pfade">See how that worked?</p>
</div>
<br/><br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Initialise Variables with the Assignment Operator</h4>

<p class="pfade">We can cut the above code above down by declaring and defining a variable in one line of code rather than over two lines. Don’t forget the semi-colon at the end:</p>
<p class="pfade box"> var var1 = 1;</p>
<p class="pfade">Boom.</p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Uninitialised Variables</h4>

<p class="pfade">When a variable is declared and brought into the land of the living, it’s initial value is undefined. Writing code with an undefined variable will result in NaN or “Not a Number”. Strings with undefined variables will return the string as “undefined”.
So, always remember to initialise your variables with a data type value!</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Case Sensitivity in JavaScript</h4>
<p class="pfade">Variable labels like “variableOne” and “variableone” are not the same variable. Different variables can use the same words but in different casing.
It’s strongly recommended that you practise writing variables in JS with camelCase, which uses the first word of a multi-word variable in lowercase and the second word in the variable label beginning with a capital letter.</p>
<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p class="pfade"> Aaaand let’s call it there for tonight, I think we’re out of the words on the basic basics of JavaScript typography. See you guys next time!</p>

    <div>
      <h2 class="pfade" id="day37">Day 37 — Basic JavaScript Part 2</h2>

      <br/>
  <div>
  <p class="pfade">Hello! Welcome back, hope you’re all having a great Sunday, the clocks went back an hour so it was nice to get some extra sleep. I’ve hardly slept this week so I slept like a log this weekend.
  let’s get back to where we were with (basic) JavaScript with lessons from FreeCodeCamp. We’re gonna start by looking at a wee bit of maths today, oh how I thought it was all behind me in high school.</p>
  </div>
  <br/><br/>
  <div>
    <h4 class="pfade">Add or Subtract Two Numbers in JavaScript</h4>
  <p class="pfade">We can do a bit of maths thanks to JS, and define numeric data with the data type Number. Using the addition operator, or the “+” symbol to all you earthly folks like me, we can add two numbers together in JS:
  </p>
  <p class="pfade box">var myNum = 5 + 10;</p>
  <p class="pfade">Here, the variable myNum is declared and then assigned the value of 15.
  The same thinking can be achieved with subtraction in JS, using the “-” symbol.</p>
  </div>
  <br/><br/>
  <div>
    <h4 class="pfade">Multiplication and Division in JavaScript</h4>
  <p class="pfade">So we want to multiply two numbers together, we use the asterisk “*” between the two digits. Easy.</p>
  <p class="pfade box">var myNum = 3 * 4;</p>
  <p class="pfade">The same goes for division. We use the forward slash “/” symbol to achieve a divide between two digits.</p>
  <p class="pfade box">var myNum = 10 / 2;</p>
  </div>
  <br/><br/>
  <div>
    <h4 class="pfade">Increment or Decrement a Number</h4>
    <p class="pfade">We can easily add one or increment the number of a variable by using the ++ operator. Instead of writing:</p>
    <p class="pfade box">i = i + 1;</p>
    <p class="pfade">We can shorten it to:</p>
    <p class="pfade box">i++;</p>
    <p class="pfade">This can also be applied when we want to minus one or decrement the number of a variable by using the “- -” operator.</p>
    <p class="pfade box">i--;</p>
    <p class="pfade">Note: In each case, the -- or ++ operator removes the need to add an equal sign.</p>
  </div>
  <br/><br/>
  <div>
    <h4 class="pfade">Create Decimal Numbers</h4>
    <p class="pfade">We can also declare a variable and assign it a decimal number, which are known as floating point numbers or floats.</p>
    <p class="pfade box">var myDecimal = 5.7;</p>
  </div>
  <br/><br/>
  <div>
  <h4 class="pfade">Multiplying or Dividing Decimals like Numbers</h4>
  <p class="pfade">We can also multiply or divide decimal numbers as if they were numbers in JS. Simply put, we can multiply decimals as:</p>
    <p class="pfade box">var myDecimal = 2.5 * 2.0;</p>
    <p class="pfade">or with division:</p>
    <p class="pfade box">var myDecimal = 2.5 / 2.0;</p>
  </div>
  <br/><br/>
  <div>
    <p class="pfade">Aaaand let’s call it there for today. I’ve been changing the door handles in our flat and need to finish up tidying. Catch you guys next time!</p>

  <section>
    <div>
      <h2 class="pfade" id="day38">Day 38 — Basic JavaScript Part 3</h2>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <div>
    <p class="pfade">Hello everyone, I’m starting night shifts now at work because of COVD-19 so these coding days have been a bit sparse of late, however I am learning at my pace, not that of someone else, so this works for me, to code in the evening a couple hours before work.. Here we go, back into ye ole’ JavaScript! We’ll be parcing through a couple more math terms today. Thanks to FreeCodeCamp for the lessons.</p>
    </div>
    <br/><br/>
    <div>
    <h4 class="pfade">Finding the Remainder in JS</h4>
    <p class="pfade">The remainder operator (“%”) is used to check a number in JS as even or odd, when the remainder is checked against the number 2. Odd numbers will result in an answer of 1 whereas even numbers will give a null output:</p>
    <p class="pfade box">48 % 2 = 0 (Even)</p>
    <p class="pfade box">17 % 2 = 1(Odd)</p>
    <br/>

    <h4 class="pfade">Compound Assignment with Augmented Maths</h4>
    <br/>
<h4 class="pfade">Addition</h4>
<p class="pfade">When using assignments to modify the contents of a variable, remember that everything to the right of the equals sign is evaluated first, and if we want to do addition as well as an assignment, we can use the += operator to do both simultaneously. So if we say:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var myVar =1;</p>
<p class="pfade box">myVar += 5;</p>
<p class="pfade">We are defining the variable “myVar” and to be equal to 1, then we add 5 to that variable, and perform the following to give the result which will equal 6:</p>
<p class="pfade box">console.log(myVar);</p>
  <br/>
<h4 class="pfade">Subtraction</h4>
<p class="pfade">The same can be applied with subtraction operations by using -= instead of +=. For example:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var myVar = 1;</p>
<p class="pfade box">myVar -= 5;</p>
<p class="pfade box">console.log(myVar);</p>
<p class="pfade">This will result in -4.</p>
  <br/>
<h4 class="pfade">Multiplication</h4>
<p class="pfade">If we want to multiply and perform an assignment at the same time, we can use the *= operator. Same process of thought as before.</p>
  <br/>
<h4 class="pfade">Division</h4>
<p class="pfade">You guessed it, we can use the /= operator for division and assignment simultaneously. Need I say more.</p>
  <br/>
<h4 class="pfade">Declaring String Variables</h4>
<p class="pfade">Strings are letters instead quotations, and for example “hello” would be called a string literal. We can type whatever we want in a string, but we must be cautious for some other types of wording..</p>
  <br/>
<h4 class="pfade">Escaping Quotations in Strings</h4>
<p class="pfade">Everything has a meaning in programming, even quotes within strings. They may be misread by JS, ah I miss HTML. So simple. If we want to make a quote within a string without alerting JS that we have reached the end of the string, we have to use a nifty little move and type a backslash before the quote:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var simpleString = “Then he looked, \“I have had a great day today\”, said John.”;</p>
<p class="pfade">Note: It’s good practise to use double quotes ( “ ” )for a string and not single quotes ( ‘ ’ ) as you may need to use the single quotes in words like “it’s” for example. If you do so, always remember that backslash: “it\’s”.</p>
<br/>
<p class="pfade">Aaaaaand let’s call it there for now. Looking forward to next time. Cheers guys!</p>

  <h2 class="pfade" id="day39">Day 39 — Basic JavaScript Part 4</h2>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
  <p class="pfade">Hello everyone, welcome back. I’ve been a bit out the loop as I have had several other things to deal with before these blogs, and now I’m sitting in the middle of a full blown cold, I thought it give this JavaScript another bash. Let’s get back on that old horsey. Thanks as always to FreeCodeCamp for the lessons…</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Escape Sequences in Strings</h4>
<p class="pfade">So where were we? Ah yes, looking at how to escape quotations inside a string. But it’s not the only character we can escape, so to speak. Here’s a table according to FFC that can better illustrate how to escape different types of characters, all preceded with a backslash:</p>
</div>
<br/>
<img class="pfade box" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/262/1*iGE-ZesGbRJq59KfI6gR3g.png" alt="diagram of escape sequences">
<br/>
<div>
  <p class="pfade"><b>Note:</b> The backlash also has to be preceded by a backslash so as not to error.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Concatenating Strings with a Plus Operator</h4>
<p class="pfade">Yeah me too, I read that as concentrating as well.</p>
<p class="pfade">What we’re talking about here is how by using the plus “+” operator with several strings, it becomes a concatenating operator. Concatonate meaning to “link together”. Sounds pretty straight forward. If we say:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var myStr = “Here is a string. ” + “Here is another.”;</p>
<p class="pfade">Then we get:</p>
<p class="pfade box">Here is a string. Here is another.</p>
<p class="pfade">Capisce?</p>
<p class="pfade"><b>Remember:</b> Don’t forget to have a space after the end of the first string so they don’t appear joined like so:</p>
<p class="pfade box">This is a string.Here is another.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
  <h4 class="pfade">Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator</h4>
  <p class="pfade">Using the “+=” operator, we can break down potentially longer strings over several lines. The code reads these lines in sequence so the sentence is built as the code is written. Remember these spaces between strings too:</p>
  <p class="pfade box">var myStr = “First. ”;</p>
  <p class="pfade box">myStr += “Second.”;</p>
  <p class="pfade">This will make:</p>
  <p class="pfade box">First. Second.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
  <h4 class="pfade">Constructing Strings with Variables</h4>
  <p class="pfade">It’s possible to create string sentence with pre-determined variables, which when using the plus operator, will concatenate (man I hate that word) them into the string. Here’s an example:</p>
  <p class="pfade box">var myDog = “Charlie”;</p>
  <p class="pfade box">var myStr = “My dog is called ” + myDog + “and he is 5.”;</p>
  <p class="pfade">You guessed it, this will create the string sentence:</p>
  <p class="pfade box">My dog is called Charlie and he is 5.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
  <h4 class="pfade">Append Variables to Strings</h4>
  <p class="pfade">Now we have a hang of the plus equals operator and variables, we can append a string sentence purely from pre-defined variables. If we first define the variables, we can then concatenate (ugh..) them together:</p>
  <p class="pfade box">var myStr = “This is ”;</p>
  <p class="pfade box">var myDog = “Charlie”;</p>
  <p class="pfade box">myStr += myDog;</p>
  <p class="pfade">This will make:</p>
  <p class="pfade box">This is Charlie</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
  <p class="pfade">Aaaaand let’s leave it there. I’m way too stuffed up on Ibuprofen to see clearly right now, and I think I have a hold of my thoughts here enough to say I need a break! See you guys tomorrow. Peace out.</p>

    <h2 class="pfade" id="day40">Day 40 — Basic JavaScript Part 5</h2>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<p class="pfade">Evening all! I hope this finds you well and ready to get stuck into class again, let’s pick up where we left off with FreeCodeCamp.
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Find the Length of a String</h4>
<p class="pfade">Cause why not ey.</p>
<p class="pfade">Simply type .length after the string to see it’s length:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var myStr = “This is a string.”.length;</p>
<p class="pfade"><b>Note:</b> Write .length immediately after the string literal or string variable.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Use Bracket Notation to Identify the First Letter of a String</h4>
<p class="pfade">Bracket Notation is one way to identify a character at a particular index (a point in the data) within a string. So you could also say [1] or [200] or whatever to identify wherever you choose to identify the Nth number of a string.</p>
<p class="pfade">Remember how coding counts from 0 onwards, not 1. So the first letter in a word is the 0th letter. This is called zero-based indexing.</p>
<p class="pfade">Let’s find out the first letter of the word “Charles”, by defining it as the variable “firstName” first, then find the first letter by defining the variable “firstLetter” using the Bracket Notation 0 for the variable “firstName”:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var firstName = “Charles”;</p>
<p class="pfade box">var firstLetter = firstName[0];</p>
<p class="pfade">This will return the answer “C”.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Understanding String Immutability</h4>
<p class="pfade">One problem is that Strings cannot be amended (they are immutable) after they have been created. However, a string can be assigned a completely new value instead, this is a way to work around that immutability instead of trying to assign edits to the string. For example:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var myStr = “Hello”;</p>
<p class="pfade box">myStr[0] = “J”;</p>
<p class="pfade">-> This will *not* change the string to “Jello”.</p>
<p class="pfade box">var myStr = “Hello”;</p>
<p class="pfade box">myStr = “Jello”;</p>
<p class="pfade">-> This *will* change the string to “Jello”.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Find the Last Letter of a String</h4>
<p class="pfade">In the event that you want to find the last letter of a string, use this formula:</p>
<p class="pfade">Within the Bracket Notation, minus 1 from the .length of the variable:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var myStr = “Charles”;</p>
<p class="pfade box">var lastLetter = myStr[myStr.length -1];</p>
<p class="pfade">The answer will be “s”.</p>
<p class="pfade"><b>Note:</b> Using a higher number will index letters in the Nth-to-last position. For example, the third last letter of “Charles” (the letter l) would be [myStr.length -3]. This means the code is counting back 3 places from the end point of the string. Understand me?</p>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<h4 class="pfade">Storing Multiple Values in One Variable with JavaScript Arrays</h4>
<p class="pfade">It’s possible to assign multiple values to one variable by separating each one with a comma, all inside square brackets. This is called an array declaration. These can be strings, numbers…</p>
<p class="pfade">Here’s an example:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var sandwich = [“cheese”, “ham”, “salad”];</p>
</div>

<h4 class="pfade">Nesting Arrays</h4>
<p class="pfade">Remember what nesting was? That’s putting one thing inside another, and here we’re able to ‘nest’ an array inside another, like so:</p>
<p class="pfade box">[[“eggs”, “ham”], [“cheese”, “salad”]]</p>
<p class="pfade"><b>Note:</b> This is also called a multi-dimensional array.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="pfade">Access Array Data with Indexes</h4>
<p class="pfade">FreeCodeCamp likes to teach one one thing followed by another, and then mix them together. We have learn’t how to index with Bracket Notation, and how to create an Array, now we’re going to use a Bracket Notation on the variable myArray with three nested values, and index that data within myArray, for example:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var myArray = [10, 40, 100];</p>
<p class="pfade box">myArray[0];</p>
<p class="pfade">This gives 10.</p>
<p class="pfade box">var myData = Array[1];</p>
<p class="pfade">This gives 40.</p>
<p class="pfade"><b>Remember:</b> To think about the zero-based indexing structure.</p>

<h4 class="pfade">Modifying Array Data with Indexes</h4>
<p class="pfade">It’s worth noting here that entries of arrays are mutable, unlike strings which are immutable, and can be freely edited after creation. Let’s hark back to this string example earlier which would not work:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var myStr = “Hello”;</p>
<p class="pfade box">myStr[0] = “J”;</p>
<p class="pfade">We can write virtually the same thing in the form of an array and it will work:</p>
<p class="pfade box">var myArray = [10, 20, 30];</p>
<p class="pfade box">myArray[0] = 15;</p>
<p class="pfade">This will mean that the data inside myArray is now [15, 20, 30].</p>
</div>

<p class="pfade">Aaaaand let’s quit whilst we’re ahead.</p>
<p class="pfade">Phew! My head was starting to spin a little there. But I really like the style of JavaScript, it’s very regimented and logical. See you next time!</p>
